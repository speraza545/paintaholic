# Paintaholic

#### Description

This application is currently designed as a estimate for people looking to have rooms in their house painted. It uses average prices for materials and labor as found online. Eventually I would like to have it update rates based on a zipcode, be able to email out the estimates, as well as eventually turn into a full on painters CRM that painting companies can use to draw clients to their business, as well as handle booking features, estimates, and other customer relation type things (such as an option to sign up for an email marketing list when creating your account). 

Currently the app allows users to pick a day and time for a job, enter in their room dimensions as well as the quality of paint they wish to use. Then uses that data to give them a ball-park estimate of what a painting company would charge for their request.
